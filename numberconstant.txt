		NUMBER CONSTANT

  Number constant are assumed to be signed decimal integers

1	start with a zero, the number is an unsigned integer 
	e.g 0456

2	starts with 0x or 0X, the number is an unsigned hexadecimal integer
	e.g 0xa7f, 0Xabc

3	Are too big to fit into a signed integer (or unsigned integer
	if octal or hexadecimal) then the constant type is a signed 
	long integer (or unsigned long integer if octal or hexadecimal)

4	Have an L or l suffix, the number is a signed long integer
	e.g 42L, 99l,.

5	Have a U or u suffix, the number is an unsigned integer 
	e.g 42U, 99u

6	Have both a U and an L suffix (or u and l), the number is an 
	unsigned long integer e.g 42UL, 99ul

7	Contain a decimal point or scientific 'e' notation, the number 
	is of type double e.g 7.3, 42e-1, 12.34E-4

8	Contains a  decimal point or scientific 'e' notation and an F
	or f suffix the number is of type float e.g 7.3F, 42e-lf

9	contain a decimal point or scientific 'e' notation and an L
	or l suffix, the number is of type long float e.g 7.3L, 42e-l

 
signed keyword :
	are number with negative (-1 to - infinite) and positive (0 to infinity) 

unsigned keyword :
	are number with only positive numbers which is 0 to infinity

Base numbers are :

1 : 	Base 2 --> which is binary (0 and 1)

2 :	Base 8 --> which is octal (0 to 7)

3 :	Base 10 --> which is decimal (0 to 9)

4 :	Base 16 --> which is hexadecimal (0 to 9 and a to f)

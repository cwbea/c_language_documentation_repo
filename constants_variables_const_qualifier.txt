		"CONSTANT" VARIABLES AND THE CONST QUALIFIERS

 A variable may be declared as constant using const qualifier.

e.g : 
	const double pi = 3.14159;
	const int year_length = 365;
	const int TRUE = 1; 
	const int FALSE = 0;

Once declared, these variables cannot have any value assigned to them or be changed
in any other way, but they can be used in expressions.

e.g : 
	pi = 1.234;		/* illegal */
	cwbea = 2*pi*rad;	/* ok */
	y = year_length;	/* ok */
	year_length = 365;	/* illegal */

It follows that const variables MUST be initialised  to be of any use.

const variables are used to make a program more readable. They also make 
a program easier to maintain if the constant needs to be changed in later 
version of the program. If the numeric value has been used the change may
need to be made in many places in the code some of which could possibly be
missed. The use of a const variable means that only one line needs to be 
changed to alter the constant value throughout the program.

Exercise 1

Which of the following data definition statements are illegal and why?

	int			Alf, Bert = 4, Cleo = 4.3, Doris = 'D';
	char			Eric = 257, Eric_Again, 3rd_Eric;
	short			Default, Default_value, default, default2;
	long			int, Fred = 123456789;
	float			x = 123.456, Y = 100 e-6;
	unsigned 		negative = -1;
	const int 		three = 4, Max, Eric = 0;
	unsigned float		George = 1.234;


Exercise 2

If a programme has only the following data definition, all of which are inside 
the main function :
	int		Ada, Bill = 4, cwbea;
	char		letter = 'A', digit = '1';
	float		Xvalue = 258.34, Yvalue;
	unsigned	val;
	const char	cw = 'A';
	
which of the following assignments are illegal and why?
	Bill = Ada;
	Ada = 0xAda;
	Bill = letter;
	Ada  = digit;
	Bill = cwbea;
	digit = 66;
	digit = '\102';
	digit = 0102;
	letter = '\9';
	letter = "A";
	letter = cw;
	Xvalue = 12.345;
	Xvalue = 1234.5 e-2;
	yvalue = Xvalue;
	val = 0177777U;
	cw = 100;
	cw = 'A';
	

Constant variables identifiers SHOULD ideally be in uppercase.

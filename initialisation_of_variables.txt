			INITIALISATION OF VARIABLES
 
 A variable can be initialised (given a starting value) when it is declared by setting
it equal to a constant value or expression. Note the variable is a memory address. 

e.g : 
	char alphabet_lowercase = 'a';
	char alphabet_uppercase = 'A';
	int number_one = 97;
	int number_two = 65;
	float pi = 3.14;
	float fraction = 10/3 

Initialisations can be mixed with other declarations 

e.g : 
	char alphabet_lowercase, alphabet_uppercase;
	int number_one, number_two;
	float pi, fraction;

If a variable is not initialised then :

	global variables are initialised by default to zero. 

	local variables declared inside a main or any other function, will have a random
	starting value. i.e There is NO default initialisation in local variables.
			i.e They will NOT have a starting value of zero.



Note :  
	initialisation of local variables does not need to be a constant. 
		e.g 	char ch = getchar();
	this will get the starting value from the keyboard.

	Note also that local variables designated are static or extern have different initialisation
	properties. These are described later in section 11 on storage classes.

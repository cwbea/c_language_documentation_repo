			Constants and Variables 
  	Declaring data Variables
In C all variables are declared before they are used.

This is so that :
	1.  A memory location is given a name.
	2.  A suitable number of byte can be allocated.
	3.  The compiler know how to treat the data.

There are several data types in C :

	Variable type		Number of bits
	   char				8
	   int			16 or 32 (usually)
	short int		      16 (usually)
	  short			      16 (usually)
	long int                      32 (usually)
           long                       32 (usually)
          float                 about 32
        double                  about 64
      long float                about 64
      long double                   > 64 

1 byte = 8 bits.
2 byte = 16 bits.
4 byte = 32 bits.
8 byte = 64 bits.
16 byte = 128 bits.

	The format of Variables Declaration

Variable names must obey the following rules:
	1.  Names can consist of letters, digits, "_"

	2.  Names must start with a letter

	3.  Names must start with the "_", underscore character but
	    this is not recommended as many system macros and functions
	    are given names in this format

	4.  Case is sensitive, ie. Xyz is not the same as xyz

	5.  Names must not clash with the C keywords


 A variable must consist of : 
	keywords 	identifiers 	operator	initialization
	 int		  name		  =		100
     	char		   fn		  =		stanley

		
		what is a variable ?
 A variable is simply  a memory address

There are two ways of declaring a variable:
 
1. Global variable
2. Local variable

Global variable: 
	are variables that are visible to the entire programme.

Local variable:
	are variables that are only visible to the function 
	where they are declared and defined.

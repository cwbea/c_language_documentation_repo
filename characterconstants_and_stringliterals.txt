	CHARACTER CONSTANTS AND STRING CONSTANTS 

Characters represented with the \ notation can also be used in string.
Strings are enclosed between " " and have an implied null character at the end.

e.g : "\a this text starts with a beep\nand covers two line "

constants cannot be spread over more than one line. However if the compiler
finds two strings constant with only space or new line in between it will
automatically concatenate the string together. 

e.g :	"hello the"
	

note that a single character given between ' ' is not the same as a string of one 
character 
i.e 'A' is not the same as "A" 

A single character in ' ' can be regarded as a means of expressing 
a number value corresponding to the ASCII value of the character

i.e 'A' is equivalent to '\101' or '\x41' and also 65

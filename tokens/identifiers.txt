		identifiers
   An identifier is a sequence of letters and digits.
The first character must be a letter; the underscore also counts as a letter. 
Uppercase and lowercase letters are different. Identifiers may have any length, and for internal identifiers at least the first 31 characters are significant; some implementations may take more
 character significance. Internal identifiers include pre-processor macro names and all other names that do not have externa l
 linkage. Identifiers with external linkage are more restricted.

		CHARACTER CONSTANTS

 Can be either single character in primes (e.g : 'A') or portable representation 
of "odd" characters.

e.g :
	'\n'		newline
	'\r'            carriage return
	'\f'            form feed
	'\t'		tab
	'\b'		backspace
	'\a'		audiable alarm (beep)
	'\0'		null
	'\\'		backslash
	'\''		prime

 Any character can be represented by \  followed by an octal ASCII
 value of up to three digits.
ASCII stands for American standard code for information interchange.
